## Introduction

This project demonstrates a basic implementation of a Neural Network trained on the MNIST dataset. The goal is to accurately classify handwritten digits from 0 to 9 using a simple neural network architecture.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Pandas

## Results

After training and evaluating the neural network model, the results can be compared if the model performs better.

- Accuracy: The overall accuracy of the model on the test set.
